  <h1>Tony Stark</h1>
  <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_Industries">Stark Industries</a></strong>.</em></p>
  <p>Anthony Edward Stark is a fictional character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—commonly known by his alter ego, Iron Man. In the films,
    Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his
    technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.</p>

  <h3>Education</h3>


  <ul>
    <li>Tony Stark first premiered as a comic book character, in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, story-artist Don Heck, and cover-artist and
      character-designer Jack Kirby.[3] Lee wanted to create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.[4] Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on Howard Hughes,[5] as
      "one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally a nutcase."[6] The character's original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the
      second
      story (issue #40, April 1963), and redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by Steve Ditko.[7] Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team. In the
      mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, which included Iron Man. Feige, a
      self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.[8]</li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau">Jon Favreau</a>, who was selected to direct the first Iron Man film, felt Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,[9] and that the actor could make Stark a "likable asshole," but also depict an authentic emotional journey once
      he
      won over the audience.[10]</li>
    <li>Ultimately though, Downey ended up being the choice the studio made for the first character in their ever-expansive cinematic universe. Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), with Downey
      frequently conversing with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man.[11]</li>
